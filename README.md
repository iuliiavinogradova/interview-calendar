## Interview Calendar Web Application

Interview Calendar Web Application
You need to implement a static web application (SPA) using create-react-app, React, styled-components, and deploy it to Heroku or any other web hosting.

Layouts with calendar design for mobile browsers:

- [Main Mobile](./1.%20Main%20Mobile@2x.png) - The main view of the calendar.
- [Delete Mobile](./2.%20Delete%20Mobile@2x.png) - After selecting an event, a Delete button appears.
- [Add Mobile](./3.%20Add%20Mobile@2x.png) - After clicking the + button, a standard prompt popup for adding an event appears (using the prompt function).

For page width <= 740px, the calendar should stretch evenly. For page width > 740px, the calendar width should be 740px, and the calendar should be horizontally centered on the page.
